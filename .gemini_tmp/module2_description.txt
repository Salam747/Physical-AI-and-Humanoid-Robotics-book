---title: Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)sidebar_label: Module 2 – Digital Twin---# Module 2  **The Digital Twin**  Physics Simulation, Gravity, and Sensor Realism### DurationWeeks 6–7### Core IdeaCode is cheap. Crashing real robots is expensive.  We build photorealistic digital twins that fall, slip, and sense the world exactly like reality — before any metal touches the floor.### You Will Master- Gazebo Classic → Ignition → Isaac Sim migration path- Converting URDF → SDF with correct inertia and collision meshes- Realistic physics tuning (friction, damping, contact stiffness)- Sensor simulation that matches real hardware noise profiles:  - LiDAR (Velodyne/Hesai models)  - Depth cameras (Intel RealSense D435i/D455)  - IMUs with bias and noise- High-fidelity apartment environments (NVIDIA Isaac Sim + Omniverse assets)- Unity for alternative visualization and HRI studies### Outcome by Week 7Your humanoid now lives in a 3-bedroom apartment complete with:- Slippery kitchen tiles- Furniture that actually blocks paths- Realistic lighting and shadows- Sensors that produce the exact same data distribution as the real Jetson + RealSense kitYou can make it fall 10 000 times in simulation and it will get back up — for free.<div className="text-center my-12">  <a href="/docs/module3/overview" className="btn btn-success btn-lg">    Next: Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) →  </a></div>
