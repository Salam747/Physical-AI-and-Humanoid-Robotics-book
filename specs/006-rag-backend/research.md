# Research Findings: Free RAG Chatbot Backend

**Feature Branch**: `006-rag-backend`  
**Created**: 2025-12-09  
**Plan**: ../plan.md

## Overview

During the planning phase for the Free RAG Chatbot Backend, no critical research questions requiring external investigation were identified. The core technologies (Gemini API, Qdrant, Neon, FastAPI, LangChain) and architectural patterns are well-understood and explicitly defined within the project's constitution and the feature specification.

## Key Decisions Reinforced

The research phase confirmed that the design decisions outlined in `plan.md` (e.g., choice of embedding model, RAG strategy, free-tier services) are sound and align with the project's constitutional constraints.

## Unresolved Questions / Future Research

None at this stage. Implementation details will be addressed during the task generation and coding phases.
