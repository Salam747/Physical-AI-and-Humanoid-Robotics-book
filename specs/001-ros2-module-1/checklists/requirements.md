# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CQ-001 No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CQ-002 Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CQ-003 Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CQ-004 All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] RC-001 No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] RC-002 Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] RC-003 Success criteria are measurable
- [x] RC-004 Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] RC-005 All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] RC-006 Edge cases are identified
- [x] RC-007 Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] RC-008 Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] FR-001 All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] FR-002 User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] FR-003 Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] FR-004 No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
