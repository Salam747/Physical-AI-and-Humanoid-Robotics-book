# LLM Integration for High-Level Planning

This chapter explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline to perform high-level task planning for robots. The focus is on translating abstract natural language commands into a sequence of executable robot actions.

## Role of LLMs in Robotics Planning

*   **Understanding Natural Language**: Interpreting user commands and extracting intents.
*   **Task Decomposition**: Breaking down complex goals into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
*   **Common Sense Reasoning**: Leveraging LLM's vast knowledge for context-aware decision-making.
*   **Adaptability**: Generating plans for novel situations not explicitly seen during training.

## Architectures for LLM-driven Planning

*   **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts to guide LLM behavior.
*   **Tool Use (Function Calling)**: Enabling LLMs to interact with external tools (e.g., motion planners, vision APIs).
*   **Hierarchical Planning**: LLMs generate high-level plans, which are then refined by classical planners or lower-level controllers.

## Integrating LLMs with ROS 2

*   **ROS 2 Clients**: Developing Python nodes to communicate with LLM APIs.
*   **Action Servers**: Exposing robot capabilities as ROS 2 Actions for LLM control.
*   **Message Definitions**: Designing custom ROS 2 messages for LLM input/output.

## Example: LLM-driven Object Retrieval

(Example pseudo-code or Python script illustrating how an LLM might receive a command like "get me the apple from the table," decompose it, and call robot actions to achieve the goal will go here.)
