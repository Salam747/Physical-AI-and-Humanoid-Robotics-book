# Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module is where Large Language Models (LLMs) finally control physical robots through Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipelines. You will learn to build a complete pipeline for LLM-driven robot control, integrating vision processing, language understanding, and robot action execution, culminating in a capstone project.
