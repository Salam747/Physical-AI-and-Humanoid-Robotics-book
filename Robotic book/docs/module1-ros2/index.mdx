# Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces ROS 2, the industry-standard middleware for robot control. You will master ROS 2 architecture, real-time Python development with `rclpy`, custom message creation, and building reusable packages. By the end, you'll have a production-grade ROS 2 workspace capable of controlling simulated humanoid robots.
