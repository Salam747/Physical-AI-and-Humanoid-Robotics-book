# Bridging External Python Agents to ROS 2 Controllers

This chapter explores how to integrate external Python applications, including advanced AI agents like Large Language Models (LLMs), with your ROS 2 robot control system. You will learn to design communication interfaces that enable high-level decision-making processes to influence real-time robot behavior.

## Why Bridge External Agents?

*   **Advanced AI**: Integrating sophisticated AI algorithms (e.g., path planning, natural language understanding).
*   **Modularity**: Decoupling complex decision-making from low-level control loops.
*   **Flexibility**: Easily swapping out different AI components without altering core robot code.

## Communication Patterns for Bridging

*   **ROS 2 Topics**: Publishing high-level goals and subscribing to robot feedback.
*   **ROS 2 Actions**: Implementing goal-based interactions for complex tasks (e.g., "move to kitchen", "pick up cup").
*   **Custom ROS 2 Interfaces**: Defining messages and services specifically for agent-robot communication.

## Example: LLM-driven Goal Setter

(Example Python code demonstrating an external agent (potentially an LLM) publishing high-level goals to a ROS 2 action server will go here.)
