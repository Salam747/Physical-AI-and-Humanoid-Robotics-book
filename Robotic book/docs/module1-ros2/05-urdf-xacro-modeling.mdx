# URDF & Xacro Modeling for Humanoid Robots

This chapter delves into the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) and its powerful extension, Xacro. You will learn how to create detailed and flexible models of humanoid robots, specifying their kinematics, dynamics, visual properties, and collision geometries.

## URDF Fundamentals

*   **Links**: Defining rigid bodies of the robot.
*   **Joints**: Specifying the connections and motion constraints between links.
*   **Visuals**: Adding visual meshes for rendering.
*   **Collisions**: Defining collision geometries for physics simulation.
*   **Inertial Properties**: Mass, inertia matrix for accurate dynamics.

## Xacro for Enhanced Modeling

*   **Macros**: Reusing common URDF structures.
*   **Properties**: Defining and using variables within your models.
*   **Includes**: Modularizing your robot descriptions.
*   **Mathematical Expressions**: Using basic math for calculations (e.g., joint limits).

## Modeling a 20+ DoF Humanoid

*   **Kinematic Chains**: Structuring the robot's limbs and torso.
*   **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**: Understanding and modeling complex humanoid movements.
*   **Materials and Textures**: Enhancing visual realism.

## Example: Humanoid Leg Segment

(Example Xacro code for a single leg segment of a humanoid robot will go here.)
