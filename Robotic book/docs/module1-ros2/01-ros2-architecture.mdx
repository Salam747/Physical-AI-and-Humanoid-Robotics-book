# ROS 2 Architecture

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) architecture, its core concepts, and how it addresses the challenges of modern robotics development.

## Key Concepts

*   **DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: The middleware that enables data communication.
*   **Nodes**: Executable processes that perform computations.
*   **Topics**: Named buses for nodes to exchange messages.
*   **Services**: Request/reply mechanisms for nodes to communicate.
*   **Actions**: Long-running goal-based communication.

## Communication Patterns

*   **Publish/Subscribe**: Asynchronous, one-to-many communication.
*   **Client/Service**: Synchronous, request-response communication.
*   **Action Client/Action Server**: Asynchronous, goal-based communication for long-running tasks.

## Advantages of ROS 2

*   **Real-time capabilities**: Improved performance and predictability.
*   **Security**: Enhanced communication security with SROS 2.
*   **Distributed systems**: Better support for multi-robot and distributed deployments.
*   **Multi-platform**: Wider operating system support.

## Example: Simple Publisher-Subscriber

(Example code for a basic ROS 2 publisher and subscriber will go here.)
