# Building Reusable ROS 2 Packages and Workspaces

This chapter details the process of structuring your ROS 2 projects into reusable packages and managing them within a `colcon` workspace. A well-organized workspace is crucial for collaborative development, code sharing, and efficient build processes.

## ROS 2 Package Structure

*   **Minimal Package**: Essential files (`package.xml`, `CMakeLists.txt`/`setup.py`).
*   **Source Files**: Organizing C++ (`src/`) and Python (`<package_name>/`) code.
*   **Message/Service/Action Definitions**: Placing custom interfaces (`msg/`, `srv/`, `action/`).

## `colcon` Workspaces

*   **Creating a Workspace**: Initializing your `colcon` workspace.
*   **Building Packages**: Using `colcon build` for efficient compilation.
*   **Sourcing the Workspace**: Making your installed packages available in the environment.
*   **Overlaying Workspaces**: Managing dependencies between different workspaces.

## Best Practices for Reusability

*   **Clear API**: Designing package interfaces for easy integration.
*   **Documentation**: Documenting package functionality and usage.
*   **Version Control**: Managing packages with Git.

## Example: Humanoid Control Package

(Example of a structured ROS 2 package for humanoid control within a `colcon` workspace will go here.)
