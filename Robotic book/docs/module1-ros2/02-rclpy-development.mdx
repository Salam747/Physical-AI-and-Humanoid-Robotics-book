# Real-time Python Development with rclpy

This chapter focuses on developing real-time ROS 2 applications using `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2. You will learn best practices for writing efficient and predictable Python code in a robotics context.

## rclpy Fundamentals

*   **Node creation**: How to initialize and manage ROS 2 nodes in Python.
*   **Publisher/Subscriber**: Implementing data exchange between nodes.
*   **Service client/server**: Creating request-response communication patterns.
*   **Action client/server**: Handling long-running, goal-oriented tasks.

## Real-time Considerations in Python

*   **Garbage collection**: Understanding its impact and mitigation strategies.
*   **Thread management**: Using multi-threading for concurrent operations.
*   **Event loops**: Asynchronous programming with `asyncio`.
*   **Performance optimization**: Tips and tricks for efficient `rclpy` applications.

## Example: Simple rclpy Node

(Example code for a basic `rclpy` node with a publisher and subscriber will go here.)
