# Realistic Physics Tuning

This chapter focuses on tuning the physics parameters of your digital twin to achieve realistic and accurate simulation results. Proper physics tuning is critical for ensuring that robot behaviors developed in simulation transfer effectively to the real world.

## Key Physics Parameters

*   **Friction**: Coefficients (static and dynamic) that govern contact interactions between surfaces.
*   **Damping**: Resistance to motion, affecting joint and link movements.
*   **Contact Stiffness and Damping**: Parameters that define how objects deform and interact upon collision.
*   **Restitution**: The "bounciness" of objects upon impact.
*   **Gravity**: The gravitational acceleration in the simulation environment.

## Tuning Methodologies

*   **System Identification**: Using real-world data to determine appropriate physics parameters.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Adjusting parameters through trial and error, comparing simulation to reality.
*   **Domain Randomization**: Varying physics parameters during training to improve robustness to real-world variations (covered in more detail in Module 3).

## Simulating Different Materials

*   **Slippery Surfaces**: Low friction coefficients (e.g., wet tiles).
*   **High-Friction Surfaces**: High friction coefficients (e.g., rubber).
*   **Soft/Deformable Objects**: Adjusting contact parameters.

## Example: Tuning a Robot on Different Surfaces

(Example simulation setup demonstrating how to adjust friction parameters and observe robot behavior on different virtual surfaces will go here.)
