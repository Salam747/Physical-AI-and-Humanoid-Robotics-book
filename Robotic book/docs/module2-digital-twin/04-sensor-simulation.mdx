# Sensor Simulation

This chapter explores the crucial aspect of simulating robot sensors to generate data that closely mimics real-world hardware. Accurate sensor simulation is vital for developing and testing perception algorithms, ensuring that software trained in simulation performs reliably on physical robots.

## Principles of Sensor Simulation

*   **Fidelity vs. Performance**: Balancing the realism of simulation with computational cost.
*   **Noise Models**: Incorporating realistic noise profiles (Gaussian, speckle, random walk) for various sensor types.
*   **Calibration**: Simulating sensor calibration errors and offsets.
*   **Environmental Factors**: Modeling how light, weather, and object properties affect sensor readings.

## Simulating Common Robot Sensors

*   **LiDAR (Velodyne/Hesai models)**: Simulating 2D/3D point clouds, range, and intensity data with realistic noise.
*   **Depth Cameras (Intel RealSense D435i/D455)**: Simulating RGB-D streams, including depth noise, IR patterns, and field of view limitations.
*   **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)**: Simulating accelerometer and gyroscope data with bias, drift, and white noise.
*   **RGB Cameras**: Simulating visual images with realistic lighting, shadows, and lens effects.

## Integrating Simulated Sensors

*   **ROS 2 Sensor Interfaces**: Publishing simulated sensor data to standard ROS 2 topics.
*   **Simulator APIs**: Using APIs from Gazebo, Isaac Sim, or Unity to access and configure sensor models.

## Example: Noisy Depth Camera Feed

(Example simulation setup demonstrating how to configure and visualize a noisy depth camera feed in a simulator will go here.)
