# URDF to SDF Conversion

This chapter details the process of converting robot models from Universal Robot Description Format (URDF) to Simulation Description Format (SDF). While URDF is excellent for describing the kinematic and dynamic properties of a single robot, SDF provides a more comprehensive representation for physics simulators like Gazebo, enabling multi-robot scenarios, environmental elements, and a richer set of physical properties.

## Understanding URDF

*   **Strengths**: Simplicity for robot description, widely used in ROS.
*   **Limitations**: Primarily describes single robots, limited environment modeling, no explicit physics properties like friction or contacts.

## Understanding SDF

*   **Strengths**: Comprehensive scene description (multiple robots, static environment, sensors), detailed physics properties, richer joint types.
*   **Benefits for Simulation**: More accurate physics, complex interaction modeling, better support for Gazebo and other physics engines.

## Conversion Process

*   **Using `urdf2sdf`**: Overview of the `urdf2sdf` tool.
*   **Manual Adjustments**: Why manual intervention might be necessary after conversion (e.g., adding detailed collision shapes, specific sensor parameters).
*   **Ensuring Correct Inertia and Collision Meshes**: Importance of accurate physical properties for realistic simulation.

## Key Differences

| Feature               | URDF                 | SDF                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Scope                 | Single Robot         | Full Scene (robot + env) |
| Physics Properties    | Basic (mass, inertia)| Detailed (friction, damping, contacts) |
| Sensor Description    | Limited              | Rich                     |
| Environment Modeling  | Minimal              | Extensive                |

## Example: Converting a Simple URDF Robot

Let's use our `simple_robot.urdf` (`examples/digital_twin_models/simple_robot.urdf`) as a starting point and demonstrate its conversion to SDF.

### 1. The Original URDF

```xml
<!-- examples/digital_twin_models/simple_robot.urdf -->
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="simple_robot">
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.1 0.1 0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.1 0.1 0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="0.5"/>
      <inertia ixx="0.001" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="0.001" iyz="0.0" izz="0.001"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>
</robot>
```

### 2. Using `urdf_to_sdf`

The `urdf_to_sdf` tool (often available as part of `ros-foxy-urdf-parser-py` or similar packages in ROS 2 distributions) can perform a basic conversion.

```bash
# Assuming you have urdf_to_sdf installed and sourced your ROS 2 environment
urdf_to_sdf examples/digital_twin_models/simple_robot.urdf examples/digital_twin_models/simple_robot_converted.sdf
```

After running this command, a new SDF file (`simple_robot_converted.sdf`) will be generated. You can compare its structure with `examples/digital_twin_models/simple_robot.sdf`.

### 3. Manual Adjustments and Enhancements

While `urdf_to_sdf` provides a good starting point, you often need to manually adjust the converted SDF for optimal simulation realism.

*   **Explicit Physics Properties**: Add or fine-tune properties like `<friction>`, `<rolling_friction>`, `<damping>` within the `<surface>` tags of `<collision>`.
*   **Sensor Definitions**: If your URDF had basic sensor definitions, you might need to expand them in SDF to include noise models, update rates, and more complex visualization properties for use in simulators like Gazebo.
*   **Joint Dynamics**: Define `<dynamics>` for joints, including friction and damping.
*   **Plugins**: Integrate simulator-specific plugins (e.g., Gazebo plugins for specific functionalities).

For example, to add explicit friction to the `base_link` in the SDF, you might modify the `<collision>` tag to include surface properties:

```xml
<collision name="collision">
  <geometry>
    <box>
      <size>0.1 0.1 0.1</size>
    </box>
  </geometry>
  <surface>
    <friction>
      <ode>
        <mu>0.8</mu> <!-- Coefficient of static friction -->
        <mu2>0.5</mu2> <!-- Coefficient of dynamic friction -->
      </ode>
    </friction>
  </surface>
</collision>
```

These manual adjustments ensure that the SDF model behaves precisely as expected within the target physics simulator, leading to a more accurate digital twin.
