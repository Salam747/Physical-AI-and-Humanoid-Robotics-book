# Reinforcement Learning Basics for Robotics

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its application in robotics. You will learn how to formulate robotic control problems as RL tasks, understand the core components of an RL system, and explore various algorithms used to train intelligent agents for complex robotic behaviors like walking and grasping.

## What is Reinforcement Learning?

*   **Agent-Environment Interaction**: Learning through trial and error.
*   **State, Action, Reward**: Defining the key elements of an RL problem.
*   **Policy**: The agent's strategy for choosing actions.
*   **Value Function**: Estimating the long-term return of states or actions.

## Key RL Algorithms

*   **Model-Free vs. Model-Based**: Learning directly from experience vs. learning a model of the environment.
*   **Value-Based Methods**: Q-learning, SARSA, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
*   **Policy-Based Methods**: Policy Gradients, REINFORCE.
*   **Actor-Critic Methods**: Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

## RL in Robotics

*   **Motion Control**: Learning to walk, run, and balance for humanoid robots.
*   **Manipulation**: Training robotic arms to grasp and manipulate objects.
*   **Navigation**: Developing intelligent navigation strategies in dynamic environments.
*   **Challenges**: High-dimensional state/action spaces, sparse rewards, safety.

## Example: Simple Robotic Arm Grasping

(Conceptual example of defining an RL environment and training an agent for a simple robotic arm grasping task will go here, potentially with pseudo-code or a high-level algorithm description.)
