## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response

The task generation phase is complete.

I have created a detailed, dependency-ordered task list in `specs/005-rag-backend/tasks.md`.

**Summary:**
- **Total Tasks**: 23
- **Phases**: 6 (Setup, Foundational, 3 User Stories, Polish)
- **MVP Scope**: Defined as completing Phases 1, 2, and 3.

The `tasks.md` file contains a checklist of all tasks required to build the backend, organized by user story and ready for implementation.

We have now completed the Constitution, Specification, Plan, and Task phases. We are ready to begin implementation.
